NXP Yocto Support for XBMC
=====================================

This Yocto layer provides support for building XBMC on NXP i.MX6 with GPU hardware.
It has only been tested on the i.MX6 QualPlus SabreSD board with FrameBuffer backend. 
Any other configuration is not supported.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------
To get the i.MX6 BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:
   $ mkdir ~/bin
   $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo  > ~/bin/repo
   $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
   $ PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

Install the i.MX6 BSP Yocto Project Environment into your directory:
   $ mkdir imx-xbmc-demo
   $ cd imx-xbmc-demo
   $ repo init -u git://git.freescale.com/imx/fsl-arm-yocto-bsp.git -b imx-4.1.15-1.0.0_xbmc-demo

Download the Yocto layers (as specified by the default repo manifest):
   $ repo sync

Configure the build (These scripts should be run only once for a specific build directory):
   $ DISTRO=fsl-imx-fb MACHINE=imx6qpsabresd source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b xbmc_fb
   $ source ../nxp-xbmc-setup.sh

Start the XBMC build:
   $ bitbake nxp-image-xbmc-demo


End User License Agreement
--------------------------
During the i.MX Yocto Community BSP setup-environment process, the NXP i.MX End User License Agreement (EULA)
is displayed. To continue, users must agree to the conditions of this license. The agreement to the terms allows the
Yocto build to untar packages from the NXP mirror. Please read this license agreement carefully during the
setup process because, once accepted, all further work in the Yocto environment is tied to this accepted agreement.
