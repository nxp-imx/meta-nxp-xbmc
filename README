# This document describes the steps to hook XBMC layer for imx6 SOC family

- i.MX6 supports XBMC in the FrameBuffer graphics backend.
- Yocto Project layer -- meta-nxp-xbmc should be included in i.MX6 XBMC build

The Steps:

1. Create the Framebuffer (FB) build folder by the configuration option "-e fb"
   $ MACHINE=xxx source fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory> -e fb

2. In your build folder, run the script nxp-xbmc-setup.sh to hook XBMC layer
   $ source ../nxp-xbmc-setup.sh
   - The script will hook meta-nxp-xbmc into conf/bblayer.conf

3. Build your image with XBMC
   $ bitbake xbmc-image
