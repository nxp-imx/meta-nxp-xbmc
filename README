# This document describes the steps to hook XBMC layer for imx6 SOC family

- i.MX6 supports XBMC in the FrameBuffer graphics backend.
- Yocto layer for imx6 xbmc image -- meta-fsl-xbmc should included in your build

The Steps:

1. Create the Framebuffer (FB) build folder by the configuration option "-e fb"
   $ MACHINE=xxx source fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory> -e fb

2. In your build folder, run the script xbmc-layer-setup.sh to hook XBMC layer
   - The script will hook meta-nxp-xbmc into conf/bblayer.conf

3. Build your image with XBMC
   - bitbake xbmc-image
