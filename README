# This document describes the steps to hook XBMC layer for imx6 SOC family

- i.MX6 supports XBMC in the FrameBuffer graphics backend.
- Yocto Project layer -- meta-nxp-xbmc should be included in i.MX6 XBMC build

The Steps:

1. Download the BSP Yocto Project Environment into your directory:
   $: mkdir imx-xbmc-demo
   $: cd imx-xbmc-demo
   $: repo init -u git://git.freescale.com/imx/fsl-arm-yocto-bsp.git -b imx-4.1.15-1.0.0-xbmc
   $: repo sync

2. Create the Framebuffer (FB) build folder by the DISTRO configuration option "fsl-imx-fb"
   $: MACHINE=imx6qpsabresd DISTRO=fsl-imx-fb source ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory>

3. In your build folder, run the script nxp-xbmc-setup.sh to hook XBMC layer.
   And it will hook meta-nxp-xbmc into conf/bblayer.conf
   $: source ../nxp-xbmc-setup.sh

4. Build your image with XBMC
   $: bitbake nxp-image-xbmc-demo
