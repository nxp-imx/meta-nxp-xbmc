# This document describes the steps to hook XBMC layer for imx6 SOC family

- i.MX6 supports XBMC in the FrameBuffer graphics backend.
- Yocto layer for imx6 xbmc image -- meta-stef should included in your build
- Current layer is the specific patches and instrcutions for the layer meta-stef

The Steps:

1. Create the Framebuffer (FB) build folder by the configuration option "-e fb"
   $ MACHINE=xxx source fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory> -e fb

2. In your build folder, run the script xbmc-layer-setup.sh to hook XBMC layer
   - The script will fetch Yocto layer meta-stef to sources
   - And will hook meta-stef and meta-fsl-xbmc into conf/bblayer.conf

3. Build your image with XBMC
   - The XBMC components are added into the list packagegroup-fsl-tools-testapps
